Analyzing a company as potential long term investment is a very tedious process. You have to pour through financial reports, read latest news and recommendatios, do your independent research before deciding on how to proceed. 

This example calculates various financial ratios, as detailed below, from data downloaded from Yahoo! Finance. It leverages Google Gemini LLM (we use `gemini-1.5-flash`) to analyze all the ratios we calculate and make an overall recommendation on the investment potential.
