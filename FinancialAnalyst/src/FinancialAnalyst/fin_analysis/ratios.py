            profitability (avoid!). Positive values indicate company is becoming more profitable.

        - Earnings Per Share (EPS) - measures profit earned by the company per share.
            Increasing EPS means company is growing profits per share - look for Y-on-Y values.
            Declining EPS means EPS is shrinking & this company should be avoided.
