# My Weekend Generative AI projects ‚ú®

### Generative AI Code projects I created over weekends using Python.

Let's accept it, Generative AI is here to stay and offers a HUGE productivity boost for text heavy tasks.
In my spare time I like doing things such as analyze a company for investment potential, watch 
technical videos on Youtube (about AI and Generative AI, of course üòâ), read/write technical blogs and so on. But I don't necessarily have the time (or the patience) to sit through the entire process. So I thought to myself: "Why not let an LLM (ChatGPT or Gemini or pick-your-favourite-LLM) do the dirty work for me?"

So I started creating a list of programs, which I find useful. I am sharing these with you in the hope that you will find them useful too. Fair warning, I am exploring & learning Generative AI, just like most of you,
so my code may not be as polished or as professional as that of a seasoned programmer. So use it for learning
and fell free to enhance it. If you like it, please do give me a shoutout.

Each project is self-contained - all code for a project is in its own sub-directory. The directory will also
have its own `requirements.txt` which shows you which Python moduled need to be installed to make that example work. It may also have a `README.md` file to explain what that project does.

I have used Video Studio Code on a Windows 11 machine to create all these projects. All these projects use
Python 3.10, installed in a local environment. 

### List of Projects 
Here is a list of projects (created so far) - this list will grow over time:
1. [You Tube Video Transcriber üìΩÔ∏èüí¨](YouTubeVideoTranscriber/README.md) - transcribes and summarized a YouTube Video, given a URL.
2. [Financial Analysis of Company Stock](FinancialAnalyst/README.ms) - given a stock symbol (such as MSFT or RELIANCE.NS), does a comprehensive analysis of Financial ratios and gives an overall analysis of the company performance.
